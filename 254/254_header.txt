254: MURDERING THOUSANDS OF GNOMES 
https://www.embedded.fm/episodes/254

Gabriel Jacobo (@gabrieljacobo) spoke with us about embedded graphics, contributing to the Linux SDL, using MQTT, and working far from his employers.

Gabriel.s blog and resume are available on his site mdqinc.com. His github repo is under gabomdq. 

SDL is Simple DirectMedia Layer (wiki). It is not so simple.

For MQTT-based home automation, he uses the Raspberry Pi Home Assistant build and many Node MCUs (ESP8266s running Lua, Micropython, or Arduino Framework).
